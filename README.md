# What To Expect In Module 3

## But First

## Emotional Preparation

### The Emotional Journey of Creating Anything Great
You will see below an image that illustrates, as the title states, "The Emotional Journey of Creating Anything Great". We want you to take a look at this because there is much that you and your cohort mates can take away from it as you enter the most intensive of the five modules:

The first point we want share with you is that it is normal to feel the weight of Module 3 (and the entire program) on your shoulders, you will not be alone in however you will be feeling. You and your cohort mates are all going through it together, so lean on each other.

The second point we want to share with you is that you should try to be aware of where you find yourself mentally and emotionally, and should act accordingly to attempt to stay out of the dark swamp. Lean on family, and remember to have confidence in your support system. If the administrative support system available to you is not clear, talk to an instructor and a meeting can be arranged between the both of you and an administrator such as the Senior Program Manager.

The third and final point we want to share with you is to keep confidence in the curriculum, it is a crafted, tried and further refined system that is built to get you ready for the workforce!

## The Content

Module 3 can be considered "front-loaded", meaning that the beginning of the module is heavier in content than the rest. The first week, including the weekend prior to the Monday of the first week, contains the majority of the material. The second week contains labs and activities built to help digest and practice the content introduced throughout week 1.

### Things to Know

* The material is more difficult because it is a new language with new quirks and vocabulary.

* The material requires much critical thinking, more than previous modules. You cannot pattern match to solve the labs.

* One topic does not always flow into the other. This is because Javascript has many moving parts.

* Ruby gave you multiple names for the same method, which may have been confusing when you learned iterators. JavaScript gives you even more flexibility on how to structure your code than Ruby.

## Independence


We want to empower you to take control of your own learning. This means learning to teach yourself how to approach new topics, debug, and find the answers to conceptual questions. For this reason, instructors will start to steer you towards resources, rather that answer your questions. We arenâ€™t avoiding the question, we want to see if you can read documentation and master google-fu. These are the skills you will need in your first job!
